# About the project

The association asked for an application that will be mainly dedicated to young entrepreneurs. In the application the entrepreneurs will be able to see each other projects in a news feed, seek help in the relevant forums and make new connections that will hopefully lead to new initiatives. 

Guests will be able to see existing projects and the association statistics.
